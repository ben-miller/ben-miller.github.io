<p>I once did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AccountingStuff">deep-dive</a> into double-entry bookkeeping and I was not expecting to become so fascinated by it. It turns out that it&rsquo;s possible to account for far more than just physical and financial assets. For example, it&rsquo;s possible - and often necessary - to account for the value of a company&rsquo;s brand or intellectual property. But these are not concrete things, and there is no obvious way of determining their value. Still, accountants have managed to come up with some clever tricks for doing so.</p>
<p>A lot of people say that they value time and experience over money, but what exactly do they mean by that? People seem to believe that in theory, but nonetheless put the majority of their waking energy into making money, and very little into making time and experiences. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that we have no meaningful way of mapping between the two. But what if there was a way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to propose a way. I&rsquo;m calling it <em>experience-value accounting</em>.</p>
<p>The heuristic is this: take an experience you&rsquo;ve had or would like to have, and consider what someone would have to pay you to <em>never</em> have that experience.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that someone walks up to you and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you $10,000 if you spend your life never leaving your home country&rdquo;. Would you accept this offer? Probably not. But what if it were $500,000? Or $10 million? Pretend there&rsquo;s an answer to that, and try to answer it honestly. I bet that for most of these things, at some point you could name a price. In a way, you&rsquo;ve just determined a kind of financial value for that experience.</p>
<p>Some other examples. How much would someone have to pay you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have never read (and never be able to read) your favorite novel</li>
<li>Have never met your closest friends</li>
<li>Never learn a foreign language</li>
<li>Never be able to travel Europe</li>
<li>Lose your left leg</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the idea that certain things have infinite value beyond money is nothing new. There&rsquo;s a reason why they call these things <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw-CK2Lj_6A">priceless</a>.</p>
<p>I once did a personal experiment based on this idea. I spent some time listing out what I value in my life in terms of relationships, experiences, skills, and education. For each of these items, I determined what someone would have to pay me to give it up. I put all of this into a ledger in GNUCash. I should make an effort to dig this up, because the outcome was fascinating. From what I recall, my &ldquo;net worth&rdquo; in these terms was in the millions of dollars, and my &ldquo;annual income&rdquo; was in the hundreds of thousands. I&rsquo;m sure it would be a lot more if I also accounted for my relationships and basic things like my limbs, lack of disease, etc.</p>
<p>If you have the time, spend an hour making an inventory of what you value in life. Maybe you&rsquo;ll discover something about your priorities, and whether they are aligned with how you are spending your time. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find that it makes sense to work a lot less than you do. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find that it makes sense to take a gap year. If nothing else, you&rsquo;ll feel enormously grateful for what you have.</p>
