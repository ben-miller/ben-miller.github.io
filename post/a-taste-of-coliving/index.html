<p>After a gap of nearly 3 years, I came to Oaxaca to have the time and space to get my career back together. A main reason for choosing Oaxaca was due to its abundance of co-working spaces. I am not a digital nomad - by definition, this requires income -, but I saw value in pretending to be one anyway. Fake it until you make it, right?</p>
<p>During my quest to find the ideal co-working space, I stumbled upon <a href="https://co404.com/oaxaca">Co404</a>, a so-called &ldquo;co-living&rdquo; space. After a brief tour of the miniature campus, I fell in love with it and signed up on the spot for my first month of accommodation. Two months later, I feel like I&rsquo;m stepping out of a time vortex. Now that I&rsquo;m in a quiet private room outside of city center, I am finally in a position to reflect on my experience.</p>
<p>It was a wild ride - an intensely social experience, always with something going on, and rarely allowing for a proper night&rsquo;s sleep. I found that it offered the social opportunities of a hostel, access to a group of intentionally-minded people, and a timeframe long enough for deep bonds to form. Unfortunately, I did not feel that it was a great environment for getting stuff done, which is why I ultimately left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life in various forms of communal living arrangements, including hostels, Japanese sharehouses, and splitting rent with friends and/or roommates. In general it&rsquo;s nice to have good people around, but this co-living experience in particular demonstrated the potential these arrangements can have, and has revived my interest in co-livings in general.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an exact definition of a co-living as differentiated from generically living together with people. But if I had to form one, maybe it would involve (1) a residential timeframe of at least 1-3 months, (2) an orientation around some common goal or interest, and (3) organized events and some degree of expected participation.</p>
<p>In this particular case, here&rsquo;s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-living helps you to make lot of close friends very quickly. Because people are incentivized to stay for a month of longer, you tend to overlap long enough with people to really get to know them.</li>
<li>Co-living can be an effective treatment for depression. In my case, it took only a few days after leaving for an intense feeling of loneliness to set in. Maybe the co-living was masking something. But maybe also we&rsquo;re not meant to live alone.</li>
<li>Co-living can really shape you. We are influenced so strongly by those who we spend time around. People are rarely intentional about this, but a co-living offers the potential to design one&rsquo;s outcomes based on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I experienced was one particular flavor of co-living. It was a great experience, but also not quite what I was going for when entering. But it made me imagine what other possibilities might exist if we were to play around with the various parameters of people, expectations, planned events, and architecture. I hope that these co-living arrangement continue to pop up, and that more of these variables will be experimented with. Maybe it could become something akin to wine or mezcal, where you have a variety of combinations of factors, each leading to its own distinctly extraordinary flavor.</p>
