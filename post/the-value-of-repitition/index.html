<p>There are countless ways of practicing meditation, and most involve fixing your attention on some physical or mental object and bringing your attention back to it, over and over again. In some sense, any way of engaging one&rsquo;s attention - by mental or physical means - repetitively and over a sustained period can be considered a kind of meditation.</p>
<p>If you meditate with enough duration and intensity, stuff starts to happen. You might find yourself in a deep, serene, or trancelike state of mind. You might find that it opens up a deep sense of effortlessness or intuition. The benefits can be profound.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to modify my definition of art such that, in order to be called art, the artifact produced must arise from a meditative state of mind, typically brought on by some repetitive artistic practice.</p>
<p>We could expand this sense of meditation to involve practices done repeteadly and in the same way by a group of people over time. Under such conditions, similar dynamics of flow and spontaneity tend to play out but at an organizational level.</p>
<p>Repitition is meditation&rsquo;s essential element, but automation strips that away from us. When we automate something, we undermine the meditative quality of the work, as well as the ability to develop a human intuition for the task at hand.</p>
<p>In many cases I don&rsquo;t think this is such a bad thing. Many types of work are painful and non-meditative, and completely worth automating so that no human has to do it. But I also wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in a world where absolutely every human task is automated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is, but I think it&rsquo;s worth thinking deeply about when to apply automation, when not to, and when to actively resist it. At the very least we need to carve out spaces where human craftsmanship is valued over technological optimization.</p>
