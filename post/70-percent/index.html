<p>I recently read Atomic Habits, and I was intrigued by an experiment done by a photography teacher, where he split his students into 2 groups. One group would, at the end of the semester, be graded by the quality of a small set of photos produced. The other group would be graded on the quantity of photos produced, numbered in, say, the hundreds. By the end of the semester, it turned out that the Quantity group kicked the Quality group&rsquo;s ass, not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. I found that story very intriguing, and it&rsquo;s been on my mind how I might go about applying the principle in various ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great example for why habits and systems are so powerful, and why they&rsquo;re worth crafting and committing to sustaining over a long period. Here I have some additional thoughts on how to take fuller advantage of this concept.</p>
<p>First of all, have perfection as the end goal of all this. You need to have this in mind as a way of orienting yourself, a source of motivation to act, and a source of inspiration of what you might do or of what elements you might include. You need to develop your sense of taste. Spend time steeping yourself in the really good stuff. Do it systematically if you can. Collect and curate high quality works as you come across them. Use this as a way of raising your standards. Make yourself aware of what &ldquo;good&rdquo; really good is, and of the vast chasm between it and your present abilities.</p>
<p>Then, once you have that, lower your standards to the ground. Start thinking in the barest minimum of terms. Lower the standards for what you expect of yourself to the smallest increment such that you are absolutely confident that you can deliver it reliably over a long period of time. You need to be OK with producing absolute crap. And you need to be OK with having people <em>see</em> what you produce in its raw, imperfect state.</p>
<p>If you go for any longer than like 2 days without delivering, then it&rsquo;s a sign that you need to minimize the scope even further. Be ruthless in this. To take a boring example, I hate flossing, and it&rsquo;s gotten to the point where all I need to do in order to count it is to floss a single tooth. Once that&rsquo;s being done consistently, I&rsquo;ll consider going full-mouth.</p>
<p>Think in terms of sprints, or mini-projects. The effort you put into a project tends to have diminishing returns as you approach its theoretical point of perfection. As you approach it, things become increasingly difficult. It follows that even a small increase in the intended quality of your project&rsquo;s outcome can have an arbitrarily large impact on the amount of effort required. By reducing the project&rsquo;s scope or expected quality by some small amount, you&rsquo;ll make a outsized reduction in the effort required.</p>
<p>I think that 70% of what you&rsquo;re capable of is a good number for this - 80% feels too high, and I get stressed at the thought of it. On the other hand, 60% gets too close to half-assing it. But feel free to pick a number that feels right to you, call it X.</p>
<p>Continue delivering consistently at X-percent of your capacity long enough, and what you consider to be half-assed will turn out to be far better than what you&rsquo;d have made on your first theoretically full-assed project. And at this point, you&rsquo;ll be continuing to deliver quality results at a fraction of the time and effort.</p>
