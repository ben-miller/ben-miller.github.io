<p>I&rsquo;ll be 34 in a few months. That&rsquo;s old enough for a wide chasm to develop between you and the peers you grew up with, went to high school or university with, or worked at your first few jobs with. I&rsquo;m browsing LinkedIn, stalking the people I used to know. People who I considered getting back into touch with personally, but who, if I reach out now during the job search I just started, might feel offended that I would only reach out as a matter of career necessity, rather than as a matter of friendship. I&rsquo;m very impressed, even surprised, by what some of them have apparently done. It&rsquo;s causing somewhat of a crisis for me.</p>
<p>These are people who I, years ago, was on a similar trajectory to. We were overachievers in high school. We grew up having parents and teachers tell us that we had the world. For some of us, this became a self-fulfilling prophecy. For others such as myself, it feels like it hasn&rsquo;t. Certainly not in terms of my career. Maybe in non-career ways I&rsquo;ve had the world, but if I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;gone places&rdquo;, it has been in a totally different way from how I was expecting to as a kid.</p>
<p>If I were capable of becoming an accomplished person, I would have done it by now. That defining decade has passed and I feel that I have very little to show for it. I sit here trying to find ways of making my LinkedIn profile a little less un-impressive. I&rsquo;ve made a few attempts at finding a unique, differentiating blurb to put in the &ldquo;headline&rdquo; box. Each time I change it, I wake up the next morning realizing how stupid it sounds. I&rsquo;ve settled on &ldquo;software engineer&rdquo;, which feels like the only truthful thing I can put there, and even that feels like I&rsquo;m pushing it.</p>
<p>I like to comfort myself at night by telling myself that I&rsquo;m on an exponential curve, rather than a linear path. Rather than taking the conventional route, I&rsquo;ve made life decisions based on first-principle reasoning - sort of like how the most successful companies focus solely on &ldquo;business fundamentals&rdquo; and ignore the short-term fluctuations in their stock prices.</p>
<p>For example, in this reasoning a major assumption I&rsquo;ve made is that <code>Education = Time x Resources</code>. If I just have a ton of time available, an internet connection, and access to the right books, materials, or tools, I can teach myself anything from first principles. Why take a class when the tuition alone is worth months of free time in an low-cost country? Even if a formal education can speed up the rate of learning, I&rsquo;d still rather have the time and space to explore freely. I realized this first in university, where I discovered that I could still ace my classes by just reading the textbook and showing up to class occasionally when they were reviewing for an upcoming test. And that&rsquo;s not to mention that my learning style is highly independent. So school hasn&rsquo;t made a lot of sense; not for me, anyway.</p>
<p>Another assumption I&rsquo;ve tacitly made is that there is value in keeping things low-pressure so that you have the freedom to wander. If you&rsquo;ve ever taken a dog on a walk, you&rsquo;ll quickly notice how difficult it can be if you&rsquo;re in an area where lots of other dogs tread. All the dog wants to do is wander around to all the other places dogs have taken a piss. I&rsquo;ve been told that it&rsquo;s like the dog-equivalent of Tinder, because a dog&rsquo;s urine encodes a lot of information about the dog, information that a passing dog finds irresistibly interesting. If the dog is particularly stubborn, it takes a lot of energy to keep it on course - it&rsquo;s almost faster just to let it wander around and sniff where it wants, as opposed to using all your energy to keep it within range of the pre-arranged path. In this metaphor I am the dog; my interests are patches of dog urine in my path; the path is the confines of what having a full-time job allows me to do in my spare time; and the leash is the effort I must expend to prevent myself from wandering off course into whatever I find interesting in the moment. Staying on course is an exhausting fight against my own impulses, and I&rsquo;ll cover a lot more ground if I just let myself go full-force at whatever is interesting to me in the moment.</p>
<p>Maybe there were some more guiding principles, like escaping local minima by making huge, drastic changes in my environment (i.e. traveling or living abroad). But the point here is not to explain my philosophy, but rather that there <em>is</em> a philosophy being followed, however poorly defined or ineffective.</p>
<p>And so, with that in mind, I have ventured forward and taken obscene amounts of time off of what would otherwise have been a linear (and probably lucrative) career track. In particular, I&rsquo;m at the tail end of my 3rd sabbatical - the first lasted 4 months, the second a year and a half, and the third (the current one) may end up exceeding 1.5 years, depending on how long this job search takes.</p>
<p>And here lies my crisis: I&rsquo;m trying to account for what I&rsquo;ve accomplished or gained from it, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a whole lot. Not nearly enough to justify what it cost me. These sabbaticals have been haphazardly planned at best. And what&rsquo;s scary to me is that these assumptions might have been flat out wrong. Like, there are actually massive benefits to being in school or work: structure and accountability, access to mentors, peers with similar interests. I can&rsquo;t believe I missed out on years of that. And taking a goalless approach to learning might only ensure that you only ever take the path of least resistance, and never learn anything difficult or relevant. And maybe the fastest path to personal growth has more to do with dominating whatever local minimum you find yourself in, rather than finding a theoretically better one somewhere else.</p>
<p>So maybe I was flat out wrong in my assumptions and approach. But at least it&rsquo;s a kind of philosophy. Very few people can say that they are reasoning about life from first principles and making bold choices based on their conclusions. Even if my conclusions turn out to be totally fucking wrong (and they very well may have been), I can adjust my approach until I get it right. I suppose this is what people mean when they talk about &ldquo;living philosophically&rdquo;. And maybe I&rsquo;ll come full circle and conclude that the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; life is exactly what I want, and perhaps the ultimate product of the trials and errors of generations of people who themselves attempted to &ldquo;live philosophically&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe there are some silver linings to this. I know a little bit about a lot of things. I&rsquo;ve been to nearly 30 countries; I&rsquo;ve lived in Japan. I have a few mildly entertaining stories to tell. I can hold a conversation. I can meditate. And to be totally honest, while a lot of it involved concerted efforts as personal development, a lot of it was just playing around because I could. And it was a blast - definitely a lot more fun that working full-time and never taking breaks lasting any longer than 2 weeks. People have mid-life crises because of that stuff. Maybe by doing this I&rsquo;ve prevented much larger problems from happening down the road.</p>
<p>In terms of my career, I am coming to terms with the fact that my time off was probably a massive net negative. It will be hard to justify it to employers. It&rsquo;s crazy to me just how much <a href="https://ben-miller.github.io/post/giving-up/">sway</a> HR departments have over our lives, even when we&rsquo;re not working. Trying to explain all this time to potential employers - or having applications tossed out on the spot because of it - makes it feel like I&rsquo;m facing some kind of Great Reckoning, where a tally has been made of my life&rsquo;s deeds and I&rsquo;m finally facing the consequences. And in this market, I might actually be fucked this time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, who knows, maybe some random bits of it will come together in some unexpectedly profitable way.</p>
<p>But truthfully, for me it&rsquo;s never been about the career, and while there are ways I might have gone about this differently, I don&rsquo;t regret this time off one bit. If I end up cleaning toilets because of it, it will have been completely worth it.</p>
