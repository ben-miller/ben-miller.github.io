<p>I was once a digital nomad, long before it was cool. This was in 2015, when I stumbled upon a paid project I was allowed to work on remotely. As soon as the contract was in place, I put my life in Boston on hold and book a one-way ticket to Europe.</p>
<p>Once there, my daily routine went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up, get ready</li>
<li>Find a cafe, ask for wifi password, order coffee</li>
<li>Stay at cafe, work from laptop until I start getting dirty looks from the staff - typically around 2-3 hours</li>
<li>Realize how much cool stuff there is around me, spend the rest of the day walking around and exploring</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad. I somehow managed to get around 6-8 hours of work done on most days. But everything outside of that was so chaotic that I&rsquo;m surprised I got anything done at all. It was a constant struggle trying to find the right environment to do work from. On days when I had meetings, it was even more complicated because I needed to find a place that not only had decent wifi, but also where I could teleconference. Co-working spaces weren&rsquo;t much of a thing yet.</p>
<p>Looking back, the experiment was a disaster. Fortunately I was able to bounce back from it by being flown out to Australia to finish the project on-site. Since then, having seen how poorly it can go, I&rsquo;ve been pretty skeptical of anyone - especially software developers - who claim to be &ldquo;working&rdquo; remotely.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m very much against the RTO movement, and would very much like to have a remote job myself. But I also realize that doing remote work requires an added layer of responsibility to ensure that you&rsquo;re actually able to get the work done.</p>
<p>Even though I am not working now, I am trying to treat my life as if I am. After a nearly 3-year sabbatical, it&rsquo;s more critical than ever for me to get back on track with my career. In an attempt to both save money and get stuff done (i.e. work on projects and prepare for interviews), I&rsquo;ve been gravitating towards remote work hotspots. Lately it&rsquo;s been Oaxaca and Mexico City.</p>
<p>The problem is that, even though it&rsquo;s been nearly 3 months, I&rsquo;ve accomplished almost nothing since coming to Mexico. And I think I know why: I&rsquo;ve been falling into the same traps as before - not staying put for long enough, not having a reliable environment to work from, among many other things which I&rsquo;ll list out in a moment.</p>
<p>Not only that, it&rsquo;s easy to lose control of time when there&rsquo;s no one relying on you for anything. There&rsquo;s nothing forcing you to wake up at a reasonable hour, there&rsquo;s no excuse you can invent to say no to the 20th social engagement of the week, and there&rsquo;s nothing preventing you from starting a new project every 3 days.</p>
<p>In an effort to troubleshoot the situation, I decided to come up with a laundry list of basic things I need in order to actually get stuff done. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it so far:</p>
<p>Living space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private room</li>
<li>Decent kitchen</li>
<li>Reading chair</li>
<li>Desk space</li>
<li>27&quot; external monitor</li>
<li>Reliable high-speed internet</li>
<li>Strong lighting</li>
<li>A place to make calls where I cannot be overheard</li>
</ul>
<p>Location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Near parks, green spaces</li>
<li>Quiet environment (day &amp; night)</li>
<li>Convenient gym access</li>
<li>Safety
<ul>
<li>Ability to walk alone at night</li>
<li>Ability to own expensive equipment (low theft rate)</li>
<li>Overall feeling of safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weather
<ul>
<li>Sunlight most days</li>
<li>Decent temperature, allowing for walks and runs year-round</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 year of location stability. Even 1 year is problably not enough. For example, I want to invest in a homelab, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense if I&rsquo;ll be moving internationally in less than 3 years.</li>
<li>Anchoring responsibility. Even something simple like in-person language classes is enough to make me feel tethered.</li>
<li>Social support / friends nearby. Affiliation with goal-oriented people. Or at least somewhere it&rsquo;s easy to meet people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back, whenever my life has spun out of control, it&rsquo;s usually due to having lacked a few of these items. Even seemingly dumb stuff like dim lighting can cause me to fall behind, for example because without it I get too sleepy to do anything after 8 PM. And the impact of that doesn&rsquo;t even come close to not having access to a gym or running paths.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of co-working and co-living spaces that have been popping up since Covid. But even these are no guarantee. Maybe, if you&rsquo;re lucky, they&rsquo;ll tick 80% of the boxes. But even so, that remaining 20% you&rsquo;ll still need to figure out for yourself.</p>
<p>I wish I weren&rsquo;t so sensitive to my environment, but I am. I think that most of us are more sensitive than we realize. Ever been to one of those upscale suburban neighborhoods where CEOs and &ldquo;top performers&rdquo; supposedly live? It&rsquo;s easy to think they&rsquo;re there because they work hard and perform well. But I think it&rsquo;s the other way around: they accomplish what they do not because of their grit, but rather due to the lifestyle they can afford to have outside of work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish it hadn&rsquo;t taken me so long to realize this. I&rsquo;ve managed to go for nearly 3 years without having it significantly affect my net worth. But it required me to move around a lot, living out of hostels and retreat centers, and staying in inexpensive countries, often with poor infrastructure. In terms of what I&rsquo;ve been spending, I bet it&rsquo;s been pretty close to the poverty line. I&rsquo;ve gotten so used to it that I haven&rsquo;t realized how it&rsquo;s affecting my ability to get stuff done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to make it my top priority to get myself into a situation ticking all of those boxes. I don&rsquo;t care how much it costs me. I&rsquo;ll get further in 3 months under those conditions than I would in an entire year without them.</p>
