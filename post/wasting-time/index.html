<p>I seem to have become pre-occupied with the topic of gap years. It&rsquo;s something that I have a history of doing, and a topic for which I hold a lot of passion and anxiety.</p>
<p>My latest gap has ballooned to nearly 3 years, in part because I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://ben-miller.github.io/post/the-case-for-giving-up-in-2025/">given up</a> on getting back into tech (for now, anyway). When asked what IÂ have <em>done</em> with all this time, I don&rsquo;t always know how to answer. I didn&rsquo;t go into it with a plan, and looking back it involved a chaotic patchwork of short-term decisions, each making sense at the time. I&rsquo;m still trying to make sense of what I did, what I gained, and what mistakes I might have made.</p>
<p>Some things I did: I learned to meditate. I read a lot. I saw some cool places. I met some cool people. I visited various friends and family members for weeks at a time. I explored my technical and mathematical interests. I grew my <a href="https://ben-miller.github.io/post/bfo-obsidian/">digital garden</a>. I wrote stuff.</p>
<p>I learned to live without a rubric. Because there was nothing anchoring me, every morning I would wake up facing an infinite number of possibilities. It became an ongoing challenge to maintain focus. I learned to develop routines, making skillful use of notes, checklists, timers, and calendar apps. I learned to manage the most chaotic person I know: myself. You might envy being in a position of having this much freedom, but it can be overwhelming. Life is a lot simpler when you have someone there to impose <em>some</em> basic structure on your time. I had none such structure, but I learned to make do.</p>
<p>While I explored a lot, I accomplished little. I seriously cannot account for how I spent all this time. Lots of started projects that never came to anything. Lots of disruptions due to moving around every few weeks or months. Countless days spent too <a href="https://ben-miller.github.io/post/giving-up/">depressed</a> to do anything.</p>
<p>In general, I wasted a lot of time. Maybe I regret it, maybe I don&rsquo;t. There are certainly things that I would do differently. But I also recognize that chaos is a necessary side-effect of exploration. I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to pay off, or if it ever will. At least I am ripe with ideas, and if nothing else I have developed the profoundly worthwhile skill of meditation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if taking this approach to the extremes that I did was worth it. I wish I had more advice for someone wanting to do something similar. I really don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d recommend it. It&rsquo;s caused a lot of problems for me. It may turn out to have cost me my career. But if so, I&rsquo;m glad to have taken one for the team. I wish more people had the courage to challenge unhealthy norms like <a href="https://ben-miller.github.io/post/dont-mind-the-gap/">employment defaultism</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that we&rsquo;ve cornered ourselves into a world where 2 days a week, and 2 weeks a year is all that we have to ourselves. That&rsquo;s nowhere near enough time to explore your interests, master a skill, read the classics, learn a language, travel the world, or question your beliefs.</p>
<p>Wasting time is important, and more people could do it if they really wanted to.</p>
