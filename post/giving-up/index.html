<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of evidence that the job market is fucked right now. The story of someone spending over a year searching for work, only to collect hundreds of rejections has become so commonplace that it&rsquo;s not worth citing. Despite the <a href="https://angelialevy.com/2011/08/06/lies-damn-lies-and-unemployment-numbers/">comically misrepresented</a> unemployment statistics published by the BLS, the <em>true</em> <a href="https://www.lisep.org/tru">unemployment rate</a> is closer to 24%. In tech, it&rsquo;s something like 200 applicants per posting right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no saying when this will improve. Maybe next year, maybe in 5, maybe never. Either market conditions will improve, we&rsquo;ll undergo some major (hopefully socialist) political shift, or things will continue to get worse. Either we&rsquo;re doomed or we&rsquo;re not. If we&rsquo;re doomed, there&rsquo;s not much that doubling down on your job search is going to do right now. If we&rsquo;re not, then it&rsquo;s a matter of waiting it out until conditions improve.</p>
<p>If you want to spend your time and emotional energy spamming hundreds of companies with your unwanted job applications, be my guest. Maybe after months of suffering you&rsquo;ll finally get that job where you&rsquo;re bound to be overworked, underpaid, and living in fear of the next round of layoffs.</p>
<p>And for those whose latest employment gap is starting to exceed 1 year - do you really think that doubling down is going to help? Every day that passes, your prospects objectively worsen. Employers have no sympathy for your situation, and the stigma around your situation will only continue to build as time passes.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but some of us are fucked. If you are looking for work now, the cards are probably not in your favor. The sooner you accept this, the better off you&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>I understand that some people have mouths to feed, or who have no savings or residual income. If that&rsquo;s the case, then please ignore this. It&rsquo;s probably not as bad as I&rsquo;m saying. But for those of us who are not in that position, why put so much energy into trying to push out those who so desperately need the income?</p>
<p>Your time is precious. Don&rsquo;t spend it fighting reality. There are so many better things that you can do with your time. This could be a turning point in your life. There&rsquo;s so much out there to explore outside the realm of traditional employment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a position to, consider riding it out until the conditions improve. You probably don&rsquo;t need as much savings or income as you think you do. There are ways of <em>really</em> making it stretch. And you don&rsquo;t need your money to last forever - it only needs to last until market conditions improve or stabilize. Maybe 3-5 years to be safe?</p>
<p>The mess we&rsquo;re in now probably won&rsquo;t last forever. And if conditions never improve, then why spend the pre-apocalypse putting yourself through hell?</p>
