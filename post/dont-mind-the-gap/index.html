<p>I&rsquo;ve taken two major years-long gaps over the course of my career: once from January 2016 to October 2017 (~2 years), and another from October 2022 to the present (~3 years). I realized recently that, out of the last 10 years, I&rsquo;ve worked for only 5 of them.</p>
<p>On paper, this is not a great situation to be in. This could haunt me for the rest of my career, as any astute interviewer will notice these gaps and have questions - if not serious concerns - about the time off. The advice commonly given by recruiters is to inflate my experience, or to make the dubious claim that I was engaging in &ldquo;freelancing&rdquo; or &ldquo;entrepreneurship&rdquo; during this time.</p>
<p>I refuse to take that advice. Let me lay out some thoughts regarding this.</p>
<p>Firstly, I value my personal integrity and professional reputation. Despite the advice often given by recruiters, I&rsquo;m not interested in truth-bending, or contributing to an industry-wide equivalent of grade inflation.</p>
<p>Secondly, what I do with my spare time - whether it&rsquo;s on the weekends or between jobs - is none of the employer&rsquo;s business. If an employer would evaluate me based on that rather than the skills I bring to the table, then I have no interest in engaging with them. I understand the employer&rsquo;s need to conduct due diligence, but beyond that I can think of few things more dystopian than the idea that my livelihood depends on me disclosing how I spend my personal time.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I believe in working to live, rather than living to work. I despise the term &ldquo;career gap&rdquo;, because it implies that a &ldquo;career&rdquo; is the default, with any time spent outside of it being an anomaly. Instead, I think of an employment period as a &ldquo;life gap&rdquo;. For me, the default mode is doing whatever I want to do, with periods of full-time employment being an interruption of that.</p>
<p>And finally, I am proud of what I did during my gap years, and attempting to misrepresent that would indicate that I am ashamed of or apologetic about it.</p>
<p>By refusing to comply with the advice to sugar-coat my gap years, I am refusing to normalize professional dishonesty, employer overreach, and employment defaultism. It is wrong and unwise for employers to penalize career gaps, and it is cowardly for employees to avoid them or to misrepresent them. There&rsquo;s no good reason for the stigma against career gaps to exist. There is a lot to be gained from taking a mid-career gap, and we&rsquo;d all be better off if people were less afraid to take them.</p>
