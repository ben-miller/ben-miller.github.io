      <title>Experience-Value Accounting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I once did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@AccountingStuff&#34;&gt;deep-dive&lt;/a&gt; into double-entry bookkeeping and I was not expecting to become so fascinated by it. It turns out that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to account for far more than just physical and financial assets. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s possible - and often necessary - to account for the value of a company&amp;rsquo;s brand or intellectual property. But these are not concrete things, and there is no obvious way of determining their value. Still, accountants have managed to come up with some clever tricks for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be 34 in a few months. That&amp;rsquo;s old enough for a wide chasm to develop between you and the peers you grew up with, went to high school or university with, or worked at your first few jobs with. I&amp;rsquo;m browsing LinkedIn, stalking the people I used to know. People who I considered getting back into touch with personally, but who, if I reach out now during the job search I just started, might feel offended that I would only reach out as a matter of career necessity, rather than as a matter of friendship. I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed, even surprised, by what some of them have apparently done. It&amp;rsquo;s causing somewhat of a crisis for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
