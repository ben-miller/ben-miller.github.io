      <title>How I structure my notes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many, I suffer from the habit of digital hoarding. Whenever I come across an idea, future plan, or piece of useful information, I add it to my ever-growing system of notes, now exceeding 10,000. As this continues to grow, every few years I need to re-think how to structure my collection of notes to so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t collapse under the weight of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through numerous phases with this. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored and/or migrated between various notetaking tools, including Evernote, Org Mode, Roam Research, Logseq, Notion and, currently, Obsidian. I&amp;rsquo;ve read a book on the Zettelkasten method, and have adopted a loose interpretation of the PARA system. Like many digital hoarders, tending to this &amp;ldquo;digital garden&amp;rdquo; has been an ongoing hobby of mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Basic Formal Ontology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back I became fascinated by the topic of ontology engineering and in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://basic-formal-ontology.org/&#34;&gt;Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)&lt;/a&gt; and the work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@BarrySmithOntology&#34;&gt;Barry Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll make a basic attempt at describing what it is and why it&amp;rsquo;s imporant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An ontology, in a very oversimplified sense, is a shared vocabulary that allows for more precise communication between various people and groups. Certain words and concepts can be easily confused if we aren&amp;rsquo;t extremely precise in what we mean. Having a well-defined ontology or &amp;ldquo;controlled vocabulary&amp;rdquo; that we can use when describing some system, event, or entity helps us to get around this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
