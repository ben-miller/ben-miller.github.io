      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a gap of nearly 3 years, I came to Oaxaca to have the time and space to get my career back together. A main reason for choosing Oaxaca was due to its abundance of co-working spaces. I am not a digital nomad - by definition, this requires income -, but I saw value in pretending to be one anyway. Fake it until you make it, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my quest to find the ideal co-working space, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://co404.com/oaxaca&#34;&gt;Co404&lt;/a&gt;, a so-called &amp;ldquo;co-living&amp;rdquo; space. After a brief tour of the miniature campus, I fell in love with it and signed up on the spot for my first month of accommodation. Two months later, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m stepping out of a time vortex. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m in a quiet private room outside of city center, I am finally in a position to reflect on my experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
