      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be 34 in a few months. That&amp;rsquo;s old enough for a wide chasm to develop between you and the peers you grew up with, went to high school or university with, or worked at your first few jobs with. I&amp;rsquo;m browsing LinkedIn, stalking the people I used to know. People who I considered getting back into touch with personally, but who, if I reach out now during the job search I just started, might feel offended that I would only reach out as a matter of career necessity, rather than as a matter of friendship. I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed, even surprised, by what some of them have apparently done. It&amp;rsquo;s causing somewhat of a crisis for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
