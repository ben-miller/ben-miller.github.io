      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read Atomic Habits, and I was intrigued by an experiment done by a photography teacher, where he split his students into 2 groups. One group would, at the end of the semester, be graded by the quality of a small set of photos produced. The other group would be graded on the quantity of photos produced, numbered in, say, the hundreds. By the end of the semester, it turned out that the Quantity group kicked the Quality group&amp;rsquo;s ass, not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. I found that story very intriguing, and it&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind how I might go about applying the principle in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
