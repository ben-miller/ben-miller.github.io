      <description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to have become pre-occupied with the topic of gap years. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I have a history of doing, and a topic for which I hold a lot of passion and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My latest gap has ballooned to nearly 3 years, in part because I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://ben-miller.github.io/post/the-case-for-giving-up-in-2025/&#34;&gt;given up&lt;/a&gt; on getting back into tech (for now, anyway). When asked what IÂ have &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with all this time, I don&amp;rsquo;t always know how to answer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into it with a plan, and looking back it involved a chaotic patchwork of short-term decisions, each making sense at the time. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to make sense of what I did, what I gained, and what mistakes I might have made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
